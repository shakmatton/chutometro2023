            <p>This is "Chutômetro". A modern version of the old brazilian guessing game created by this programmer, back in the 2000s.</p>
            <p>Try guessing a number. The less attempts you need to guess the right one, the better your player ranking position will be.</p>
            <p>Good luck and have fun! :)</p>
